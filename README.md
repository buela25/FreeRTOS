ESP32_FreeRTOS with Azure_iot_middleware_freeRTOS - This project explains how to integrate azure_iot_middleware freertos project
into existing freeRTOS project. 

Detailed overview of middleware sdk is given in https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-middleware-freertos

This explains how the middleware is integrated as ESP-Component in my project:                      

ðŸš€ ESP-IDF: Built-in vs Custom Components ðŸ”§
Working with ESP32? Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown you should know:

ðŸ”· Built-in Components (Provided by ESP-IDF):
 Core libraries maintained by Espressif, available out of the box {freertos, esp_wifi, nvs_flash, esp_event}

ðŸŸ¢ Custom Components (User/3rd-party):
 These include:
 â€¢ Logic you write (e.g., sensor drivers, app logic)
 â€¢ 3rd-party libraries (e.g., Azure IoT SDK, MQTT, OTA)
Organize them under the components/ directory to keep your project modular and scalable.

ðŸ’¡ Why Custom Components Matter:
 âœ… Keeps your main/ directory clean
 âœ… Enables code reuse across projects
 âœ… Supports easier testing and CI
 âœ… Simplifies integration and maintenance

ðŸ§© How Azure Middleware Helps
 Hereâ€™s the architecture I followed ðŸ‘‡

Instead of manually integrating CoreMQTT, TLS, and TCP/IP, Azure provides a ready-to-use middleware layer that handles:
 â€¢ MQTT abstraction
 â€¢ Secure TLS communication
 â€¢ Azure SDK integration for IoT features like Device Twins, Telemetry, Plug and Play, and Provisioning
âœ… This modular approach reduces porting effortâ€”letting you focus only on your platformâ€™s drivers while reusing a well-layered stack.
